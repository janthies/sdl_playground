The project is a complete mess.

Firstly I'm playing around with SDL and imgui.
On top of that I'm also building a small Archetype based ecs. I've already noticed a couple of poor design decisions that eventually would need to be fixed, however, getting this project to a  a minimalist and working state is the top priority. 
This is the first time I'm writing a bigger project in a C-Style way too, so there are still lots of language quirks I'm picking up on the way
